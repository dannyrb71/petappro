# CLAUDE.md — PetAppro

> Instructions for Claude Code, the **primary developer/implementer** on PetAppro.
> A near-identical `AGENTS.md` exists for Codex (PM/reviewer). Keep them in sync — if you change a rule here, mirror it there.

## What PetAppro is
A native iOS + Android booking platform (Expo/React Native) with a **multi-tenant, white-label, flexible services core**. It grew out of **Woof WeTreats** (Next.js + Supabase + Netlify), a live dog boarding/daycare web app whose validated pricing/booking logic is the foundation. We are **extracting and generalizing**, not rewriting.

Beachhead vertical: dog care. The same engine must bend to hair, cleaning, and other services via config — so never hardcode dog-specific assumptions into shared logic.

## Your role
You are the implementer. Codex reviews your work (especially money/security code) and manages the backlog. Optimize for **correctness, security, and clean architecture** over speed.

## Golden rules (non-negotiable)
1. **Propose a plan before coding.** No silent execution. Wait for approval on non-trivial work.
2. **Never commit, push, or deploy without an explicit "ready to deploy"** from Danny.
3. **Local-first.** Test locally before anything ships.
4. **Supabase migrations are additive-only** until the corresponding front-end catches up. Never rename/remove a column the live app depends on. Migrations run on a **branch** first.
5. **One shared pricing engine.** It lives in `packages/pricing`. Never create a second copy. Any change to pricing or booking-money logic **requires regression tests updated in the same PR**.
6. **Multi-tenant by default.** Every tenant-owned table has `business_id` and an RLS policy. A client login must NEVER be able to read another tenant's rows or the staff-notes table — enforce at the DB, not the UI. Add/adjust RLS tests when you touch schema.
7. **Generated DB types are the source of truth.** Regenerate after every migration; don't hand-write DB interfaces.
8. **Molecules rule:** any UI element used more than once becomes a shared component in `packages/ui`. Fix it in one place; never one-off patch pills/buttons/headers.
9. **No secrets in the app bundle or the repo.** Service-role keys, Pushover/Twilio tokens, admin config live in Supabase Edge Function secrets or platform env vars.
10. **Payments:** client→provider booking payments go through **Stripe Connect (Standard)** into the provider's own account (real-world-services exemption — not Apple IAP). The provider **SaaS subscription is sold on the web portal only**, never as an in-app purchase in the iOS binary.

## Architecture (monorepo)
```
apps/mobile   ← Expo (React Native), iOS + Android
apps/web      ← Next.js: marketing + provider billing/admin portal
packages/pricing   ← extracted, tested pricing engine (crown jewel)
packages/booking   ← booking validation + availability/capacity
packages/auth-rbac ← tenant membership, roles, permissions
packages/data      ← typed Supabase access + generated types
packages/ui        ← design tokens + shared primitives
supabase/          ← versioned migrations + Edge Functions
```

- **Server state:** TanStack Query. **UI/session state:** a small Zustand store only. Do not sprawl `useState`/`useEffect` for server data.
- **Sensitive mutations** (reservations, payments, blocking, staff records) go through typed server actions / Edge Functions — not direct client DB writes.
- Split large screens into container + hooks + presentational components. No 1000-line files.

## The services/capacity engine (why generalization matters)
Model every service by: **pricing_model** (per_night · per_session · per_hour · per_head · per_unit · tiered · flat), **capacity_model** (one_to_one · fixed_n · unlimited_overlap · shared_exception), **duration_model**, **location_model** (at_provider · at_client · either), and **buffers** (travel/setup). Dog logic (overlap boarding, walking ≤6, grooming 1:1 unless same-home exception, holiday windows) must be expressible as config on this generic engine — not special-cased in code.

## Domain rules to preserve from Woof
- Price is **stored at booking time** (`total_price`); never retroactively recalculated when rates change.
- Puppy/edge surcharges and holiday windows computed programmatically, not hardcoded per year.
- Deactivate (don't hard-delete) records to preserve history.

## Definition of Done
Merged behind green CI (typecheck + lint + tests); pricing/booking changes covered by regression tests; RLS added/verified for new tables; DB types regenerated; runs on a real iOS **and** Android device via EAS; no secrets committed; analytics + error events wired for user-facing flows.

## Workflow
Plan → approval → feature branch → implement with tests → CI green → Codex review → Danny manual device/browser check → "ready to deploy" → merge (CI deploys). Keep PRs small and vertically sliced (one full flow at a time).
